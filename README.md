# About Me
Hi, I'm Omachoko Tanimu Yakubu! I have a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a strong focus on digital currencies, networking, and Cybersecurity. 
I'm passionate about literature, computer networking, artificial intelligence, and the digital world. 
Currently, I'm honing my skills in Cybersecurity and penetration testing, using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, Kali Linux, Splunk, Python, Nmap, etc. 
I'm always eager to learn and stay updated on emerging trends and technologies.
